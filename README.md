# open-artboards
 A photoshop script which opens each artboard in a new window, and moves the artboard to [0,0].

 It provides a similar funcitonality to the default 'File > Export > Artboards to Files' script, except:
 - it doesn't save the files, instead it opens them in separate tabs
 - it doesn't cut the content outside of artboards, which happens with 'Artboards to Files' if you updated PS to 2022 (2023?)
 - works on linux

 The point is that after using the script, you can copy CSS with top/left values relative to just the artboard, instead of the whole canvas.
